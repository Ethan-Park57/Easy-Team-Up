# Easy-Team-Up

We tested our app on a Pixel 2 API 30.

To run our app, open Android Studio and hit the green triangle Run button in the top right. 

You can register a user which will log you in and take you to the Events List (leftmost icon in NavBar). Your password must be at least 6 characters long.
Then you can create some events by following the directions on the screen in the second icon in the NavBar.
If you make the event public (!isPrivate) then the event will appear in the Events List tab.
Then, you can go to the third icon (Manage) on the NavBar and see that the event is under "Sent Events".
If you go to a event on the Events List (first tab) and click on one, then click the register button, the event will then appear under Registered Events in the Manage tab.
Received Events is not complete. 
You can also go to the Registered Events and withdraw from an event.
You can also go to the last icon (Profile) and edit details about your profile including setting an profile picture.

Put this GoogleMapsAPI key in the local.properties file as "MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyABm-K2oYJy7jmJSdpjtavL-xlbQpqbIqe"

You've been added to our Firebase project with your email zhaoxuzh@usc.edu if you think it will be helpful to look at that.
